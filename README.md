# Usage
+ Drop the file into the custom_components/media_player directory.
+ Edit your configuration file to add the `virgintivo` platform to the `media_player:` section.

# Configuration
There are is one required section: tivos, two sections of which at least one is required: tvchannellists and channels, plus one optional section: guide.

Platform settings are:

| Name | Default | Description | Example |
|:---- |:-------:|:------------|:--------|
| platform _(req)_ | | Must be virgintivo | virgintivo |
| default_is_show _(opt)_ | true | Channels default to shown/hidden | true |
| force_hd _(opt)_ | false | Switch to HD if available | false |
| keep_connected _(opt)_ | false | Persistent telnet connection to Tivo | false |
| show_packages _(opt)_ |  | TV packages to show | Free-to-air,Player,Mix,Fun,Full House |

**NB:** if using the _force_hd_ functionality, it is advisable to set _scan_interval_ to a low value, e.g. 1 to allow the component to change to the HD channel quickly.

## tivos
The Tivos should be listed under the `tivos:` section.  Each entry has two required settings and one optional.

| Name | Default | Description | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|:--------|
| name _(req)_ | | Friendy name of Tivo box | Virgin Tivo |
| host _(req)_ | | IP or name of Tivo box | TIVO-C68000012345678 |
| force_hd _(opt)_ | false | Switch to HD if available | false |
| keep_connected _(opt)_ | false | Persistent telnet connection to Tivo | false |

## tvchannellists
This allows automatic updating of the channel lists from the TV Channel Lists site. Overrides are available to customise the list as required.

NB: If both _tvchannellists_ and _channels_ are configured, the site will be tried first and if this fails the local channel configuration will be used.

| Name | Default | Description | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|:--------|
| enable _(req)_ | | Enable this functionality | True |
| url _(opt)_<sup>1</sup> | | URL for channel listing | |
| ignore_channels _(opt)_ | | Ignore these channels from the site | 0 |
| show_channels _(opt)_ | | Show the channel in the sources list | 101,102,103,104 |
| hide_channels _(opt)_ | | Hide the channel in the sources list | 990,991,992,993 |
| logos _(opt)_ | | Channel logo to display | <pre>101: https://www.mysite.uk/images/bbcone.png</pre> |
| targets _(opt)_ | | HA entity to change | <pre>901: media_player.family_room</pre> |
| sources _(opt)_ | | Source on _target_ to choose | <pre>901: Virgin V6</pre> |
| override _(opt)_ | | Override for a channel | <pre>override:<br>  101:<br>    name: BBC One<br>    package: Player<br>    is_hd: False</pre> |

<sup>1</sup> The built-in URL used is currently https://www.tvchannellists.com/List_of_channels_on_Virgin_Media_(UK).  It is not recommended to change this as the component is unlikely to understand a different site.

## channels
Channels come under the `channels:` section.  Each entry has a number of optional settings and one required setting (name).  Use next/previous track to switch between the +1 and normal versions of a channel.

| Name | Default | Description | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|:--------|
| name _(req)_ | | Friendy name of channel | BBC One |
| show _(opt)_ | | Show the channel in the sources list | false |
| package _(opt)_ | | TV package | Mix |
| hd_channel _(opt)_ | | HD channel number if applicable | 108 |
| plus_one _(opt)_ | | +1 channel number if applicable | 114 |
| logo _(opt)_ | | Channel logo to display | http://freeview.com/images/e4.png |
| target _(opt)_ | | HA entity to change | media_player.main_tv |
| source _(opt)_ | | Source on _target_ to choose | HDMI2 |

## guide
The guide settings come under the `guide:` section.  This section has a number of optional settings.

| Name | Default | Description | Example |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|:--------|
| enable_guide _(opt)_ | true | Enable the guide functionality | false |
| cache_hours _(opt)_ | 12 | How many hours of the guide to preload | 12 |

# Example

This is a minimal example only and uses the online channel list.  Use example1.yaml in the repository for a fuller example of setting up the online channel list and example2.yaml for a full set of manual channels. In /resources there is a tool to create the full channel list from the online source if desired.

```
  - platform: virgintivo
    tivos:
      1:
        name: Virgin V6
        host: TIVO-C68000020000000
    tvchannellists:
      enable: True
```
